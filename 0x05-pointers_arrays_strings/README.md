# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## In this project, we will be working of tasks that help us interact with arrays, strings and pointers.

TASK 0: 98 Battery st.  

	*Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.  

TASK 1: Don't swap horses in crossing a stream  

	*Write a function that swaps the values of two integers  

TASK 2: This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read  

	*Write a function that returns the length of a string.  

TASK 3: I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them   
	*Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout   
TASK 4: I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear   
	*Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.  
TASK 5: A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes   
	Write a function that reverses a string.  

TASK 6: Half the lies they tell about me aren't true   
	* Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.  

TASK 7: Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half  
	* Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.   
	* Prototype: void puts_half(char *str);  
	* The function should print the second half of the string  
	* If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2  

TASK 8: Arrays are not pointers  
	* Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.  
	* Prototype: void print_array(int *a, int n);  
	* where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed  
	* Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space  
	* The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array  
	* You are allowed to use printf  

TASK 9: strcpy  
	* Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);   
	* return value: the pointer to dest.
